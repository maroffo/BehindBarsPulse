# BehindBarsPulse

**BehindBarsPulse** is a personal project that combines my interest in experimenting with LLM-based agents (primarily using OpenAI and Gemini models) and the need to raise awareness about the dire state of the Italian prison system.

This project aims to create a daily automated newsletter that collects and synthesizes news from the websites [Ristretti Orizzonti](https://ristretti.org/) and [Antigone](https://www.antigone.it/), making information more accessible and impactful.

## Project Goals

1. **Experimentation with LLM Agents:**
   - Use state-of-the-art large language models (OpenAI, Gemini) to automate tasks such as web scraping, content summarization, and newsletter generation.

2. **Awareness and Advocacy:**
   - Highlight the challenges and issues faced by the Italian prison system.
   - Provide a consistent, well-curated source of information for those interested in justice reform and human rights.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **AI Models:** OpenAI and Gemini
- **Cloud Services:** AWS (using credits) for hosting, email distribution, and other cloud services

*Note: The technology stack is still being defined and will evolve as the project progresses.*

## Current Features

- **Data Collection:** Extracting content from Ristretti Orizzonti and Antigone websites.
- **Content Summarization:** Using LLMs to generate concise, readable summaries of daily news.
- **Newsletter Automation:** Preparing and formatting the newsletter for daily distribution.

## Future Plans

- Enhance automation workflows using AWS Lambda and other serverless technologies.
- Implement personalization options for newsletter subscribers.
- Add multi-language support to reach a broader audience.
- Open the project for community contributions.
